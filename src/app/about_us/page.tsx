        The internet is without a doubt the most important technological
        development in human history. Web3 and metaverse technologies expand the
        internet as we know it by introducing novel features and advancements.
        Metaverse will make use of all aspects of modern technology, including
        3D, VR, AR, AI, blockchain, cloud computing, voice computing, ambient
        computing, and more. Citi is the latest Wall Street business to give a
        positive prognosis for Web 3.0 and the Metaverse, terms used to depict a
        future internet vision centred on decentralised technologies and virtual
        worlds. Citi stated in a March 2022 research paper that the metaverse
        economy might have a total addressable market of up to $13 trillion and
        five billion people by 2030.
